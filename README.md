# bearbot3

I am currently runnign Bearbot on a tg4.small which is roughly 15? a month. Originally I had planned on running it with AWS Batch on Spot EC2 and host static assets on S3.

It seemded a lot easier to do everything on Github Pages and Github Actions (once again).
This was I am also running Bearbot for absolutely free!
